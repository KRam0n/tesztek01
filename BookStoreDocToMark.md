## Brief Overview of the Technology

### Front End - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

**HTML**  
- HTML stands for HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE, which is most widely used language on web to develop web pages. HTML refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link available on a web page is called Hypertext.
- HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but “HTML 2.0” was the first standard HTML specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in 2012.
- As its name suggests, HTML is a Mark-up Language which means you use HTML to simply “mark-up” a text document with tags that tells a web browser how to structure it to display.
- Originally, HTML was develop with the intent of defining the structure of documents like heading, paragraph, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers. Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML.

**CSS**  
- Cascading Style Sheet is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language Although most often used to set the visual style of web page and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.
- CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
- The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents 
- CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties. A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.

**Bootstrap**  
- Bootstrap is a free and open-source, front-end web frame work for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only.
- Bootstrap is modular and consists of a series of less stylesheets that implement the various components of the toolkit. These stylesheets are generally compiled into a bundle and included in web pages, but individual components can be included or removed. Bootstrap provides a number of configuration variables that control things such as color and padding of various components.
- Since Bootstrap 2, the Bootstrap documentation has included a customization wizard which generates a customized version of Bootstrap based on the requested components and various settings.
- As of Bootstrap 4, is used instead of less for the stylesheets. Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript code.

### Back End - PHP, MySQL

**PHP**  
The PHP Hypertext Pre-processor (PHP) is a programming language that allows web developers to create dynamic content that interacts with databases. PHP is basically used for developing web based software applications. This tutorial helps you to build your base with PHP. PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.

- PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".
- PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.
- It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, Postgre SQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.
- PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time.
- PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP4 added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first time.
- PHP is forgiving: PHP language tries to be as forgiving as possible.
- PHP Syntax is C-Like.

**MySQL**

- MySQL is a database, widely used for accessing querying, updating, and managing data in databases.
- MySQL is an open source RDBMS that relies on SQL for processing the data in database. MySQL provides APIs for the languages like C, C++, Eiffel, JAVA, Perl, PHP and Python. MySQL is most commonly used for web applications and for embedded applications and has become a popular alternative to proprietary database system because of its speed and reliability. MySQL can run on UNIX, Windows and Mac OS.

## Spiral Model

The **Spiral Model** combines elements of both iterative and waterfall models, with a strong focus on risk analysis. It is particularly suitable for large, high-risk projects where requirements are unclear and need to be refined over time. The model allows for incremental development and continuous refinement through multiple iterations or "spirals."

### Key Phases of the Spiral Model:

1. **Identification Phase**:
    - In the initial spiral, the business requirements are gathered and analyzed.
    - In subsequent spirals, system requirements, subsystem requirements, and unit requirements are identified and refined.
    - Regular interaction between the customer and system analyst ensures that the requirements are well understood.
    - At the end of this phase, a prototype or version of the product is deployed in the identified market for feedback and further refinement.

2. **Design Phase**:
    - Begins with a conceptual design during the baseline spiral.
    - Subsequent spirals involve detailed architectural design, logical design of modules, physical product design, and final design.
    - As each spiral progresses, the design becomes more refined based on the feedback from previous spirals and risk analysis.

3. **Construction or Build Phase**:
    - A working prototype or a Proof of Concept (PoC) is developed during the early spirals.
    - As the product matures through iterations, higher clarity on design and requirements allows for the construction of increasingly refined working models.
    - These models are shared with the customer for feedback, ensuring that the final product is aligned with customer expectations.
  
4. **Evaluation and Risk Analysis Phase**:
    - Risk analysis is a crucial element in each spiral, focusing on both technical and management risks such as schedule delays, cost overruns, or technical feasibility issues.
    - After each iteration, the customer evaluates the progress of the software, tests the build, and provides feedback.
    - Based on this feedback, the development team addresses potential risks and plans the next iteration.



### Spiral Model Process

The **Spiral Model** operates through multiple spirals, each consisting of four phases: Identification, Design, Construction, and Risk Evaluation. After completing each spiral, a new version of the product is released or further refined, depending on customer feedback and risk analysis. This cyclical process repeats until the final product is developed.

The **Spiral Model** diagram represents the cyclical nature of the development process, showing how each iteration passes through the four phases.

*(Figure 2: Spiral Model)*

![spiral model](kepek/sipral.png)

### Advantages of the Spiral Model:
- **Risk Management**: The model emphasizes early identification and mitigation of risks through continuous evaluation.
- **Customer Feedback**: Frequent iterations allow for customer feedback at every stage, ensuring the final product aligns with expectations.
- **Flexibility**: The model can accommodate changes in requirements as the project progresses, making it ideal for projects with evolving needs.
- **Prototyping**: Prototyping is a core feature, allowing for testing and refining ideas early in development.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for large, complex projects that need to be developed and delivered incrementally.

### When to Use the Spiral Model:
- When project requirements are unclear or likely to change over time.
- For medium to high-risk projects where risk management is crucial.
- In long-term projects where there is a need for continuous refinement.
- When customer feedback is essential throughout the development cycle.

### Disadvantages of the Spiral Model:
- **Complexity**: Managing the spirals can be complex and requires strict oversight and careful planning.
- **Cost**: The model can be expensive due to the high emphasis on risk management and continuous iterations.
- **Risk of Continuous Iteration**: Without proper control, the project may fall into an endless loop of development and evaluation without reaching completion.

### Spiral Model in Bookstore Management System

In the development of the **Bookstore Management System**, the Spiral Model was adopted to ensure flexibility and continuous improvement based on customer feedback. Each iteration involved:
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating potential risks in database design, user interface development, and system performance.
- **Prototyping**: Building and refining prototypes at the end of each spiral, ensuring the system met user expectations for usability and functionality.
- **Customer Interaction**: Engaging with stakeholders at regular intervals to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

By using the **Spiral Model**, the project was able to handle evolving requirements, maintain focus on risk management, and incorporate customer feedback effectively, resulting in a robust and user-friendly **Bookstore Management System**.

# Chapter 3: System Design

## 3.1 Overall System Design Using Designing Tools

The Purpose of Design Phase is to plan a solution for problem specified by the requirements. System Design aims to identify the modules that should be in the system, the specification of those modules and how they interact with other to produce the results. The goal of the design process is to produce a model that can be used later to build that system. The produced model is called design of the system.

System Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.

---

### Physical Design

The Physical Design is a graphical representation of the system’s internal and external entities and the flow of data into and out of these entities. Tools like Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), E-R Diagrams, and Use Case Diagrams are used to represent the system.

#### Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

- **0 Level DFD**: Represents the website flow.  
  *(Figure 4: 0 Level Data Flow Diagram)*

- **1st Level DFD**: Represents detailed data flow for user interactions.  
  *(Figure 5: 1st Level Data Flow Diagram)*

*(Figure 6: BMS Flowchart Diagram)*

---

### Use Case Diagram

Use case diagrams represent the interaction between users and the system. They display the relationship among actors and use cases.

- **User Use Case Diagram**

# Chapter 4: Testing and Implementation

## 4.1 Testing Approach Used

### Black Box Testing
Black-box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings. It is also known as specification-based testing. This method can be applied to every level of software testing, including unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.

*(Figure 37: Black Box Testing)*

Black-box testing helps identify:
- Incorrect or missing functions.
- Interface errors.
- Data structure errors or external database access issues.
- Behavioral or performance issues.
- Initialization and termination errors.

**Advantages of Black Box Testing**:
- It tests from a user’s perspective and helps in exposing discrepancies in the specifications.
- The tester does not need to know programming languages or how the software is implemented.

---

### White Box Testing
White-box testing examines the program structure and derives test data from the program’s internal logic. It is also known as glass-box, clear-box, or structural testing.

White-box testing involves:
- **Statement Coverage**: Ensuring all programming statements are exercised with minimal tests.
- **Branch Coverage**: Running tests to ensure that all branches are tested at least once.
- **Path Coverage**: Testing all possible paths, meaning all statements and branches are covered.

**Advantages of White Box Testing**:
- Encourages careful reasoning about the implementation.
- Reveals hidden code errors.
- Supports the identification of code issues regarding best programming practices.

---

### Gray Box Testing
Gray-box testing is performed with limited information about the internal workings of an application. Testers have access to detailed design documents but may not have full visibility of the entire system.

*(Figure 38: Gray Box Testing)*

## 4.3 Implementation Approaches

The biggest challenge encountered was time constraints. Implementation takes a significant amount of time and coordination. Scheduling project meetings was difficult, as many group members were unable to devote the necessary focus required during this stage.

Another issue was the lack of familiarity with **PHP**. Some group members were new to PHP and had to learn it quickly. This problem is likely to occur in an academic setting, where different group members have varying levels of experience.

The **Responsibility Matrix** tool was invaluable in managing the project. It assigned tasks to specific individuals and held them accountable for their completion. This tool allowed us to track progress and ensured that everyone remained on task.

# Chapter 5: Conclusion

## Conclusion

At first glance, the **Bookstore Management System** appears to be a comprehensive system, but it has several limitations. It is mainly used for listing book categories, managing customers, and handling book-related tasks. The system is designed to help customers view book information and manage their bookstore purchases.

We encountered challenges such as database creation, designing the system's front end and back end, and coding. Additionally, only one user can use the system at a time, and certain features, like a service module, are missing.

However, we gained valuable knowledge in various programming languages and tools such as **jQuery, PHP, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS**.

---

## 5.1 Limitation of the System

- **Help**: Currently, the help feature is unavailable. Users cannot get help within the system.
- **Payment**: The online payment feature is not available. Users cannot pay online.
- **Multilingual Support**: The system does not support multiple languages.
- **Backup & Recovery**: Users cannot back up or recover their data.
- **Other Limitations**: Several additional features are not implemented.

---

## 5.2 Future Scope of the System

- **Help Module**: A help module will be added to guide users on how to navigate the system. All functionalities will be described, and users will be able to access it easily.
- **Online Payment Module**: Users will be able to make online payments, making the payment process easier and faster.
- **Multilingual Support**: The system will support multiple languages, allowing users to work in their preferred language.
- **Backup & Recovery**: A backup and recovery feature will be added, enabling users to secure their data.
